# Architecture Overview

## System Components

### 1. Multi-Agent System
- Orchestrator coordinates between specialized agents
- Each agent has a specific domain focus
- Agents share context and collaborate on complex queries

### 2. Backend Services
- FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
- PostgreSQL for user and transaction data
- MongoDB for conversation history
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Vector stores (Pinecone/Chroma) for semantic search

### 3. AI/ML Components
- LLM (GPT-4) for natural language understanding
- Custom ML models for transaction categorization
- Embeddings for semantic search
- Voice processing (STT/TTS)

### 4. Frontend Application
- Next.js for server-side rendering
- React for UI components
- TailwindCSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- State management with Zustand
- Data fetching with React Query

## Data Flow

1. User Input Processing
   - Text/voice input received
   - Authentication & rate limiting
   - Request logging

2. Agent Orchestration
   - Input analysis
   - Agent selection
   - Context management
   - Response generation

3. Knowledge Retrieval
   - Vector similarity search
   - Document retrieval
   - Context assembly

4. Response Generation
   - LLM processing
   - Response formatting
   - Voice synthesis (if needed)

## Security Measures

- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Data encryption
- Secure API keys management

## Scalability Considerations

- Containerized deployment
- Microservices architecture
- Caching strategy
- Database indexing
- Load balancing
